## Overview

The Image Source allows users to add static images (like logos, overlays, or backgrounds) to a LiveLens scene.

## Image Editor Features

### Dynamic Preview & Cropper
The left side displays your image with a blue frame representing the current crop area.
- **Visual Cropping**: Drag the blue handles at the **Top-Left** and **Bottom-Right** corners of the frame to crop out unwanted parts of the image.
- **Aspect Ratio Awareness**: The preview area automatically adjusts to match the aspect ratio of the loaded image.
- **Dark Overlay**: Areas outside the blue crop frame are dimmed in the preview to show exactly what will be hidden on the canvas.

### Image Settings Controls
- **Change Image**: Tap the **Change Image** button to select a new file from your device.
- **Opacity**: Adjust the **Opacity slider** (0% to 100%) to make the image transparent. This is great for adding subtle watermarks or semi-transparent overlays.

### Apply Changes
Tap the **Apply** button at the top right to save your crop and opacity settings.
