# Chat Box Source

## Overview

The Chat Box Source allows you to display a real-time, high-performance native chat overlay in your LiveLens scene. 

Unlike traditional web-based overlays, LiveLens uses a **Native Rendering Engine** (OpenGL + Android Canvas) to ensure smooth animations, low memory usage, and perfect legibility even during high-intensity streaming.

## Important Notice: Chat Visibility

If your Chat Box is not showing any messages, please note the following requirements:

- **Supported Platforms**: Currently, LiveLens only supports native chat integration for **YouTube** and **Twitch**.
- **Login Required**: You must be logged into your YouTube or Twitch account within the app and start the stream directly through the app's native streaming feature for the chat to be captured.
- **Custom RTMP Restriction**: If you are using a **Custom RTMP** server to stream, the Chat Box will **not** display any messages as the app cannot fetch the chat data from external RTMP servers.

## Technical Features

### Platform Integration
The Chat Box automatically aggregates messages from all connected platforms (YouTube, Twitch, etc.). Each message includes:
- **Platform Icon**: A small icon (e.g., YouTube logo) next to the sender's name.
- **Author Name**: Stylized according to the selected template.
- **Message Content**: Supports multi-line wrapping and emojis.

### Performance & Animation
- **Native GPU Rendering**: Chat messages are rendered using OpenGL textures, ensuring zero lag on the main UI thread.
- **Smooth Animations**: Supports entry animations like "Slide-Left" or "Fade-In" based on the template design.
- **Directional Flow**: Templates can be configured to flow from **Bottom-to-Top** (standard) or **Top-to-Bottom**.
